* Introduction
An event-driven job-worker that runs background jobs on receiving messages from RabbitMQ.

Basically it is based on *Actix* and *Amiquip*.

Lapin is not considered because I want a simple approach with minimal black-magic.

This can be used as a template for quick application scaffolding.

Planning to make 2 templates out this:
- One is a atix-job-worker working with a single amqp broker - single consumer, one exchange one queue , from one single
  connection
- Multi-Brokers (*WIP*)

* Setup

Install dependencies
#+begin_src shell
$ cargo check
#+end_src

Refer to ~src/.env~ for environment config, make any adjustment if neccesary

Run the app
#+begin_src shell
$ cargo run
#+end_src
